This extension displays your investing.com portfolio holdings directly on asset pages.

When you visit a stock or ETF page on investing.com, the extension shows your position details (quantity, average buy price, total value, and profit/loss) in a panel on the page. This eliminates the need to switch between the asset page and your portfolio to see your holdings.

The extension only works on investing.com and only displays data from your existing investing.com portfolios.
