The storage permission is used to cache portfolio data locally in the user's browser.

When the user visits investing.com, the extension fetches their portfolio holdings. This data is stored locally using chrome.storage.local to:

1. Improve performance - Avoid fetching portfolio data on every page load
2. Reduce server requests - Minimize calls to investing.com's servers
3. Enable instant display - Show holdings immediately when visiting asset pages

The cached data includes: portfolio names, asset symbols, quantities, and average buy prices. No sensitive information like passwords or authentication tokens is stored.

Users can clear this cached data at any time using the "Clear All Data" button in the extension popup.
